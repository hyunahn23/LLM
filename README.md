# Large Language Model (LLM) Overview

## What is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and interact using human language.  
These models use deep learning techniques to predict the next word or sentence, enabling natural conversations, text summarization, translation, coding assistance, and more.
